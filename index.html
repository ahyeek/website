		<p>
		I graduated as Bachelor in Computer Science major in Artificial Intelligence in year 2002. I have done an intensive study in Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic when I was doing my final year thesis project, which is entitled "Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation implementing Neural-Fuzzy (Neural Network + Fuzzy Logic) Technique simulated in JAVA Network Simulator". This project proposed a Neural-Fuzzy model for intelligently adjusting the bandwidth allocation for ATM network.</p>
		<p>
		I continued to work as Research Assistant for 2 years at the same time pursuing Master of Computer Science in computer science at University of Malaya, Malaysia. The fields of research that I involved during my master program are Image Processing & Computer Vision, Biological Computational System, Computer Graphics and High Performance Computing. After 2 years of works, I have published a journal paper entitled "Non-Invasive Method for Patient-Specific Virtual Heart Based on Fiber-Fluid Model". The results of simulation are available here. This project has won multiple awards including Gold medal award of the Invention Exhibition of New Invention, Techniques and Products 2005 held in Geneva and ITEX Bronze Medal award of the 16th International Invention Innovation Industrial Design & Technology Exhibition 2005 (ITEX 2005). Due to the excellent achievement, I was awarded the 'Saintis Cemerlang' (Excellent Scientist) award by Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia in August 2005.</p>

		Upon obtaining MSc in Computer Science in 2005, I have joined Intel Corporation as Station Controller Developer. My job scope involved developing series of software to control production machines and collect quantitative monitoring data of those machines. The 2-years experience in this job allowed me to gain extensive knowledge in semiconductor assembly line. I started to understand about machine vision technology, especially industrial-based vision technology for defect detection and monitoring in production line. In 2 years time, I have successfully completing in delivery 4 machines to customer and also completely delivered the projects awarded by government grants.  Involving in such a startup company has tremendously increased my knowledge not only in technical fields, but also in marketing, business analysis and customer service area.</p>
		<p>
		I have worked at National Research Center Malaysia, MIMOS, as staff researcher for Knowledge Technology cluster. I was involving in projects related to Semantic Technology and Image Understanding, which belongs to Artificial Intelligent Center in the cluster. I has been contributing my effort in realizing research area related to ontology-driven image content understanding and retrieval. I was also working with a principal researcher in multi-model processing framework building as part of the Semantic Technology platform. Research and development of Image Understanding software components is one of my major contribution. They involve various low-level image processing techniques, such as image segmentation, features of interest extraction, color analysis and image classification, in combination with semantic technologies for high-level conceptual knowledge analysis; where the domain image resources are CCTV surveillance images and health care images, such as MRI, CT and X-Ray images. As conclusion, I had completed 8 papers, 7 published; 12 patents; 5 filed, developed 3 Proof-of-Concepts system, helped in organizing 3 AI conferences.</p>

		I have decided to join Hewlett-Packard (HP) Malaysia. Knowing HP is going to heavily involve in technology related to Big-data analytic, it is very exiciting for me to explore and gain additional knowledge in this domain. I have been working with technologies such as Hadoop, Autonomy, Vertica and Qlikview. I am making contribution in setting up a Big-data analytic environment, which equipped with processing and development capability. The environment contains various Apache Hadoop open source technologies such as HDFS, HBase, Hive, Flume, Sqoop, Pig, Mahout and Oozie. I also involved in Map-Reduce program development, scripts writting and Hadoop processing environment administration. Besides, I have been making effort in sourcing the trainings that related to these technologies to our local team and attending these trainings as well. I am heavily involve in communicating and engaging projects that related to Autonomy, Vertica and Qlikview from US, India and China sites to Malaysia site, in oder to enable our local team to capture significant amount of knowledge in Big-data analytic area. Furthermore, as HP is highly adopting the culture of making meaningful innovation using cutting edge IT technologies, I have been involved in making PoCs to show case the usage of how these big-data technologies add value to various business use cases. To date, I have been developing 1 PoC, which based on Autonomy meanining-based computing technology,  another one is based on Hadoop technology. Besides, I have been writing up 2 technical white papers based on these PoCs.
